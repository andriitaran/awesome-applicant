# AWESOME-APPLICANT Project Build with TypeORM

Hi, Nathan! Thank you for taking your time to review my submission! Unfortunately, I didn't have time to do testing in Jest as I was trying to stay faithful to 1-hour time allotment (plus it's not that easy to setup initial Jest testing with TypeORM). Let me know if you'd like me to that that :)

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command to install dependencies
2. Run `docker compose up -d` to spin up a PostgreSQL database container in Docker
3. Run `npm start`
